<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This is a recipe for a really tasty Pepperoni Pizza. I highly recommend everyone try this recipe once!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>16 oz pizza dough</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup pizza sauce</ul>
<ul>25 pepperoni slices</ul>
<ul>15 oz grated mozzerella cheese</ul>
<ul>1 tsp. ground black pepper</ul>
<ul>2 tsp fresh ground oregano, optional.</ul>
<ul>Loose flour for rolling, shaping, and handling dough</ul>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<ol><li>Take the dough out of its packaging and place it on a pre-floured baking tray.</li>
<li>Using a bread-roller or other cyllindrical object, roll the dough until it is flat and round, alternating directions.</li>
<li>Place the dough into a SQUARE pan, round pizza is terrible, making sure to grease it with butter or olive oil lightly beforehand</li> 
<li>Add sauce, cheese, and pepperoni, in that order, and then bake until crispy. Don't worry, you'll know.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: If you made your own dough and sauce, make sure to let the dough rest before manipulating it into the pan.</p>
